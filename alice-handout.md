1. Circle a number listed below. This number is "a".

  ```
  a =   6   7   8   9   10
  ```

2. Find the number you circled in column "a" in the grid above. Circle the row that contains that number.
3. Find the circled number in column "A" (capital A). Announce that number so everyone can hear.
4. Listen for Bob to announce his number.
5. Bob's number is "B". Write it below:

  ```
  B = ______________________
  ```

6. Locate the column with the header "B{Bob's number}". For instance, if Bob said "10", you should locate the column labeled "A10". Circle the column with this header.
7. Turn over this sheet of paper and in large writing, write the number that is in both the row and column that you circled.
